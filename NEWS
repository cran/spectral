spectral 2.0
==============

* add summary() and print() functions
* add deconvolve() function to perform analytically deconvolution
* add standardized PSD and false alarm probability to spec.fft-function
* spec.fft handles NA-values by zero padding and simple energy recovery.
* enhance calculation speed by multithreaded BLAS (must be replaced by user)
* add 1D FFT interpolation function
* read out cache size for memory usage in spec.lomb
* bug fix memory calculation in spec.lomb()
* bug fix single frequency in spec.lomb()
* optional cluster (hpc) calculation in spec.lomb()
* adding a progressbar to spec.lomb()
* waterfall() calculates PSD as well
* changed variable band width in waterfall()
* waterfall also ignores NA values and corrects
* adding progress bar to waterfall()
* extending band pass function BP() by sinc, bi-cubic and gauss kernels
* modified all dependend functions which use band pass BP()
* add Hanning window function

spectral 1.3.1
====================

* spec.lomb: phase value at f = 0 -> 0


spectral 1.3
====================

* improved documentation
* FFT as well as any LOMB version work with *multivariate* input
* Added generalized Lomb-Scargle method
* improved speed of both the normal Lomb-Scargle Method and generalized Lomb
* power spectral density is now normalized to sample variance
* limit memory usage


spectral 1.0
====================

* development of all functions
* development of concepts
