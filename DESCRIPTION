Description: Fourier and Hilbert transforms are utilized to perform several
    types of spectral analysis on the supplied data. Fragmented and irregularly
    spaced data can be processed in terms of Lomb-Scargle method. Both,
    FFT as well as LOMB methods take multivariate data. A user friendly
    interface helps to interpret the results.
